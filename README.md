2023-10-11: This app was made for Freestyle Libre v1, and does not work for the v2 or v3. Since v1 sensors are not produced and sold anymore I'm archiving this project.

Freestyle Libre is a wearable sensor that measures the glucose level through the blood plasma.

Sugartop is an android app that logs the data from your Freestyle Libre sensors.

## Data integrity
Sugartop puts you in control of your own data by only saving it locally, and letting you export it either as a csv-file or as the raw database.

## Features
- Supports multiple sensors at the same time.
- Calibrate your sensor with manually entered glucose readings. (Sensors need individual calibration)
- Shows average, standard deviation, time in target, number of readings and number of lows.
- No limit of how much data the app holds (lol why did Abbott include a 90 day limit in their app?)
- Export your data out of the app, as a file, to any service that can receive it. (Like email, google drive, Feem.)
- Free and Open Source Software.

## How it looks like

## Warning:
- If you end up using this app, it's your responsibility to take care of your diabetes. If the app does not work properly I take no responsibility, yadayada. If something is not working as intended, post an issue, or a pull request.
